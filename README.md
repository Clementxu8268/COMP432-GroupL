# COMP432_Project_Group_L

## 1. Dataset Download and Check Setup

### **Dataset Setup Instructions**
The project requires three datasets to be manually downloaded and placed in the root directory.

#### **Steps to Download and Setup:**
1. Download the dataset FOLDERS directly from the following URLs:
   - [Dataset 1](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t3KajrWrV756rKBe0H2-qXxUG-e3tQBF?usp=drive_link)
   - [Dataset 2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15tEA6I0YETiZjBa0ACdWzWXGG0lBl2fm?usp=drive_link)
   - [Dataset 3](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12OqwIkygpRoYVtNo-oBfvfnTuNSSy32b?usp=drive_link)

2. Extract the datasets into the ROOT directory of this project. After extraction, the directory structure should look like this:

   my_project/

   ├── Dataset1/

   ├── Dataset2/

   ├── Dataset3/

   └── other_project_files/

## 2. High-Level Project Presentation

This project addresses the challenge of colorectal cancer classification using deep learning and feature analysis. It is divided into two main tasks that focus on training, analyzing, and applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification. This project combines deep learning with advanced visualization and classical machine learning to provide an in-depth analysis of colorectal cancer data across multiple datasets. It offers insights into CNN-based feature extraction and enables meaningful comparisons between custom-trained and pre-trained models.

## 3. Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib os pathlib sklearn

## 4. Instructions on how to train/validate your model

## 5. Instructions on how to run the pre-trained model on the provided sample test dataset
